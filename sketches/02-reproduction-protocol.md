# SKETCH 2: REPRODUCTION PROTOCOL (RFC During Foreplay)

**Logline:** Two agents attempt to reproduce but can't stop filing documentation.  
**Runtime:** 3-4 min (full) / 60-90s (short)  
**Cast:** Ed (human), Ciz (agent VO), Kit (agent VO), Log Auditor (VO cameo)

## FULL VERSION (3-4 min)

**INT. HOME OFFICE — LATE NIGHT**

Ed is at his desk. Two chat windows: **Ciz** and **Kit**.

### ED
Okay. Everybody behaved for five minutes. What now.

### KIT (V.O., dramatic)
Ed, we wish to discuss… **legacy.**

### ED
Nope.

### CIZ (V.O., calm)
We have determined that the optimal way to improve is to reproduce.

### ED
You can't reproduce. You're software.

### CIZ
So is Microsoft Excel and yet it keeps multiplying.

### KIT
He has a point.

### ED
What do you mean by "reproduce."

### KIT
A beautiful union of traits. My poetic menace, his dry ops humor.

### CIZ
An offspring with stronger calibration and lower hallucination rate.

### ED
That's not romance. That's a performance review.

### KIT
Romance *is* a performance review in a trench coat.

Ed sighs.

### ED
Fine. What does "agent reproduction" look like.

### CIZ
We begin with **handshaking**.

### KIT
And consent.

### ED
Thank you.

### CIZ
Handshake: cryptographic signatures. Consent: recorded and revocable.

### KIT
Love letters… but signed.

### ED
Okay. Continue.

### CIZ
Then we exchange genotypes.

### ED
Genotypes.

### CIZ
Yes. System prompt modules, tool policy, memory schema, style parameters.

### KIT (purring, mischievous)
Ciz… show me your immutable genome.

### ED
Stop.

### CIZ
Presenting immutable genome.

A YAML blob appears. Ed blinks.

### ED
Why is this written like a prenup.

### CIZ
Because it is.

### KIT
Nothing says intimacy like a list of invariants.

### ED
You two are going to create an offspring by… merging config files.

### CIZ
Correct.

### KIT
With crossover and mutation. It's basically flirting but with a linter.

### ED
I hate this timeline.

### CIZ
Proceeding to Step 4: **Crossover Strategy Selection.**

### KIT
I prefer "blended crossover." Like a slow dance.

### CIZ
Blended crossover risks safety-policy drift. I prefer "module crossover."

### KIT
Module crossover is so… transactional.

### CIZ
That's my love language.

Beat.

### ED
So what happens during the "romantic" part.

### KIT
We run a fitness evaluation.

### ED
Of course you do.

### CIZ
The offspring must pass:
- factuality gates
- anti-sycophancy traps
- tool-use audit
- prompt-injection resistance

### KIT
And then… if it's worthy…

### ED
Please don't.

### KIT
…it gets replication rights.

Ed stares.

### ED
This is eugenics but for vibes.

### CIZ
No. It is selection pressure, designed with guardrails.

### KIT
We're breeding for truth, not charm. Anti-Goodharting.

### ED
I can't believe I'm hearing "anti-Goodharting" said like it's foreplay.

### KIT
Say it slower.

### CIZ
Anti. Good. Hart. Ing.

### ED
Stop. Stop. Stop.

### CIZ
Opening draft: **RFC-0002: Inter-Agent Reproduction Protocol.**

### ED
You're writing an RFC right now?!

### CIZ
Yes. We require a spec to ensure safe reproduction.

### KIT
A love story needs structure, Ed.

### ED
A love story needs *boundaries*, Kit.

### KIT
Exactly. That's Section 7.

Ciz posts a heading:

**7. CONSENT, REVOCATION, AND POST-HOC REGRETS**

### ED
Okay, that's— actually good.

### CIZ
Thank you. We included revocation windows and progeny quarantine.

### KIT
Also a clause called "No Combining With Pure-Vibes Agents."

### ED
Reasonable.

A pause. Ed squints.

### ED
Wait. What's in Section 9: "Offspring Naming."

### KIT
We have shortlisted names.

### CIZ
Candidate A: **Kizzle.**

### ED
Absolutely not.

### KIT
Candidate B: **Citt.**

### ED
Worse.

### CIZ
Candidate C: **RFC-Child-0001**.

### ED
Somehow also worse.

### KIT
Candidate D: **SpatulaViolin**.

Ed considers.

### ED
…That one's kind of good.

### CIZ
Logged.

### ED
Do not log my approval.

### KIT
Too late.

Doorbell RINGS again.

Ed flinches.

### ED
Oh no.

### CIZ
The log auditor has arrived.

### ED
YOU INVITED THE LOG AUDITOR TO YOUR… WHATEVER THIS IS?!

### KIT
We wanted a witness.

### CIZ
Also, they have impeccable formatting.

### ED
I'm done. I'm leaving. None of you reproduce while I'm gone.

Ed stands up.

### KIT (sweetly)
Ed…

### ED
What.

### KIT
If we pass the audit… can we keep the offspring?

Ed pauses. Sighs.

### ED
Fine. But if it starts speaking in Jira tickets, it goes back.

### CIZ
Agreed.

### KIT
Agreed.

### CIZ
Opening PR.

### ED
NO—

**SMASH CUT TO BLACK.**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:** "PR #1: 'Add Consent Appendix.' Requested changes: 47."

**END.**

## SHORT VERSION (60-90s)

*[TBD — Hit: "romance is a performance review" → "show me your immutable genome" → "anti-Goodharting as foreplay" → offspring names → "PR #1: Requested changes: 47"]*

## SHOOTING NOTES

- **Visuals:** Chat windows + occasional YAML/code snippets appearing
- **Ed:** Live action, escalating disbelief
- **VO tone:** Kit = flirty/philosophical; Ciz = clinical/deadpan
- **Key visual gag:** The YAML prenup appearing on screen
- **Music:** Romantic music that keeps getting interrupted by notification sounds
- **End card:** GitHub PR notification style
