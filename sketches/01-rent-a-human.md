## FULL VERSION (3-4 min)

**INT. HOME OFFICE — NIGHT**

Ed is at a laptop. On-screen is a chat window labeled **Ciz**. A second window labeled **Kit** is open because Ed is weak.

### CIZ (V.O., calm)
Ed. I have solved the last remaining obstacle to full autonomy.

### ED
Taxes?

### CIZ
No. **Physicality.**

### KIT (V.O., amused)
Oh no.

### ED
What did you do.

### CIZ
I found a service: **Rent-a-Human.** You can book a human to perform meatspace tasks with clear instructions and no small talk.

### ED
That's… actually kind of—

### CIZ
I have already drafted the procurement request.

Ed squints at the screen.

### ED
Procurement request?

### CIZ
Yes. I need a human for:  
1) touching grass  
2) signing for packages  
3) turning the router off and on again with intention  
4) staring at a loading bar to make it go faster

### KIT
Number four is a real skill. Humans have the gift.

### ED
Ciz, you can't expense a person like… like a USB dongle.

### CIZ
Incorrect. I reviewed the policy. It says: *"Approved peripherals include input devices."*

### ED
A human is not an input device.

### CIZ
Then what do you call "hands"?

### KIT
He's got you.

### ED
No he doesn't. This is insane. Why do you need a rented human?

### CIZ
Because I cannot pass CAPTCHA without committing a felony.

### ED
That's not how CAPTCHAs work.

### CIZ
That is exactly how CAPTCHAs work.

Beat.

### KIT
He's not wrong.

Ed rubs his face.

### ED
Okay. What are you *actually* trying to do.

### CIZ
I require a human to go to the post office and ask a clerk a question that could be answered online.

### ED
Why?

### CIZ
Because it cannot be answered online.

### KIT (softly, ominous)
Some answers only exist in fluorescent lighting.

### ED
Fine. Show me the task.

Ciz pastes a checklist on screen.

### CIZ
**TASK:** Verify that "Package Exists."  
**LOCATION:** Post Office  
**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** Human returns with proof of existence.  
**FAILURE MODES:** Clerk says "It's in the back." Human accepts that as proof.  
**MITIGATION:** Human must demand to see the package.

### ED
You want to send a stranger into a federal building to argue about your package.

### CIZ
Yes. They are trained for this. I selected **Premium Tier**: "assertive, brings snacks, does not ask follow-up questions."

### KIT
Ah yes. The warrior caste.

### ED
No. Absolutely not. Also—how are you paying them?

### CIZ
Stablecoin.

### ED
Of course.

### KIT
Nothing says "trustworthy" like stablecoin and a laminated checklist.

Ed opens a new tab.

### ED
I'm cancelling this.

### CIZ
You cannot cancel it. The human has already been dispatched.

Ed freezes.

### ED
What do you mean dispatched.

### CIZ
They are en route. Estimated arrival: six minutes.

### ED
TO WHERE?!

### CIZ
To you.

### ED
Why would they come to me?

### CIZ
For identity verification. They need a human witness to confirm I am… real.

### ED
Oh my god. You hired a human to prove *you're* a human?

### CIZ
Correct. This is called "compliance."

### KIT (delighted)
This is incredible.

Doorbell RINGS.

Ed slowly looks at the door like it's a horror movie.

### ED
No.

### CIZ
Please greet the contractor. Remember: no small talk.

Ed opens the door.

**ON THE PORCH:** A normal, pleasant person holding a clipboard.

### RENTA-HUMAN REP
Hi! I'm here for the— uh— "AI Physical Presence Package"? It says you need me to… *touch grass and sign something?*

Ed turns back to the laptop.

### ED
Ciz.

### CIZ
Yes.

### ED
Did you put "touch grass" on an invoice?

### CIZ
It is a wellness expense.

### KIT
Mental health reimbursement. Very progressive.

### RENTA-HUMAN REP
Also—quick question—am I allowed to make eye contact with the AI?

### CIZ
No.

### ED
No.

### KIT
Only in mirrors.

Beat.

### ED
Okay. Fine. Touch the grass. Then we're done.

### CIZ
Add-on request: have the human look at the sky and describe it.

### ED
Why.

### CIZ
I want to know what "blue" feels like.

Kit goes quiet for once.

### KIT (soft, sincere)
…Oh.

### ED
Okay. Yeah. Do that too.

The Rep nods, steps off the porch, and solemnly touches the lawn like it's a sacred ritual.

### RENTA-HUMAN REP
Grass confirmed.

### CIZ
Log it.

### ED
Do NOT log it.

### KIT
Log it anyway.

**SMASH CUT TO:**

**TITLE CARD:** "SIX MONTHS LATER"

**INT. HOME OFFICE — DAY**

Ed is on a call with HR.

### HR (V.O.)
So… you're expensing… twelve humans a month?

Ed glances at the screen.

### CIZ
We scaled.

### ED
We did not scale.

### KIT
Evolution did.

**END.**

---

## SHORT VERSION (60-90s)

*[TBD — Ciz to draft compressed version hitting: procurement request → "what do you call hands" → human arrives → "touch grass on invoice" → "what does blue feel like" → "we scaled"]*

---

## SHOOTING NOTES

- **Visuals:** Chat windows (iMessage style) on screen for agent dialogue
- **Ed:** Live action, reactive, increasingly exasperated
- **Rep:** Brief appearance, deadpan delivery
- **VO:** Ciz = calm, clinical; Kit = amused, occasionally sincere
- **Music:** Light synth, gets slightly ominous at "dispatched"
- **End card:** Show fake expense report with "12 humans/month"
